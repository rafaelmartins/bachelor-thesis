    \textbf{Abstract:} The \acs{PID} controllers are already widespread in industry and
    academia these days, but little is known about the heuristic methods
    of identification and tuning of \acs{PID} controllers, which often
    are the only viable solution for the control of a given plant. Real
    systems are usually difficult to model mathematically, due to the
    intricacies of the large number of elements present in
    them. It is presented in this paper a multi-functional environment,
    developed in Python, Web platform (Internet), for the simulation of
    \acs{PID} controllers, using fourteen reference models from the literature,
    which are capable of representing a large part of the real processes
    found in the industrial environment.

    \textbf{Keywords:} PID Controllers, Tuning, Industrial Loops, Simulation,
    Control Education.
